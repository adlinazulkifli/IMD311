        <p><b>Talking about high school life, I had enjoyed my high school life to the fullest and had some of the best memories of my life. When I’ve in the senior year, I was moved to a new school which was close to my father’s office. At first, I was really afraid as all the people were new to me. But soon, I started enjoying my senior year life and made some fantastic friends. I loved everything about my new high school and participated in the events or programmes that the school held. Even I joined the school uniform bodies camping in my school and participated in many competitions that occurred in school.</b></p>

		<p><b>One of the best things about high school life is that you get a new experience every day. In my high school life, along with studying, me and my friends enjoyed a lot of other things. We shared a lot of stories, planned a trip after the high school, had new experiences, and learned many new things. I never thought I would meet great friends like them all of a sudden. People say that high school is going to be the best things in your life and being that I’m a senior, I would have to agree. This last year as a student in high school has been awesome. My personality hasn’t changed, I’m still a carefree girl, just with a little more wisdom and a lot more strength.</b></p>
